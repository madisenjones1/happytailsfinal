    <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
    <p>Happy Tails was founded out of a deep love for animals and a commitment to their health. After our beloved pitbull, Cruze, began experiencing allergies, we struggled to find pet food that met his needs. That journey led to our mission: to create a pet supply store that puts quality, organic nutrition at the forefront.</p>

    <p>We are proud to serve the North Platte community with a selection of products that support animal wellness, focusing on natural ingredients, allergy-friendly options, and sustainable brands.</p>

    <h3>Meet Cruze</h3>

    <p>Cruze is more than just our inspiration—he's the heart of our brand. His journey motivates us to help other pet parents give their companions the happiest, healthiest lives possible.</p>
