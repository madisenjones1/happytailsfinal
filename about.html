    <p>Happy Tails was founded out of a deep love for animals and a commitment to their health. After our beloved pitbull, Cruze, began experiencing allergies, we struggled to find pet food that met his needs. That journey led to our mission: to create a pet supply store that puts quality, organic nutrition at the forefront.</p>

    <p>We are proud to serve the North Platte community with a selection of products that support animal wellness, focusing on natural ingredients, allergy-friendly options, and sustainable brands.</p>

    <h3>Meet Cruze</h3>

    <p>Cruze is more than just our inspiration—he's the heart of our brand. His journey motivates us to help other pet parents give their companions the happiest, healthiest lives possible. As you can see by the photo on the left, Cruze was having an allergic reaction to pollen. We did our research and found foods to work with allergies in our pets. The photo on the right is a recent picture of Cruze, no hives and softer than ever!</p></center>
